## Support the Rail


> _What would we do without it — Nancy Spero_

The Brooklyn Rail is an essential voice in independent journalism. In our eighteen years we have never wavered in our commitment to FREE DISTRIBUTION; THE CREATIVE LABOR OF ARTISTS AND WRITERS; AND REFLECTING THE DIVERSITY, COMPLEXITY, AND INVENTIVENESS OF OUR CULTURAL LANDSCAPE.

We reach over fifty thousand readers monthly, who pick up the Rail in print around the city or read the Rail online. In order to bring rigorous, imaginative writing into the hands of the public each month, we depend on individual donations from our readers. At this critical juncture, we are asking for your support to keep the Rail alive.

Each copy of the Rail costs $8 to produce and print.
Please donate $1 a month for the year today!
