  <p>For 19 years, <em>The Brooklyn Rail</em> has never wavered in its commitment to providing an accessible and independent forum for the arts. 2019 has been a particularly monumental year for the <em>Rail</em>, with curatorial projects at both the <a href="https://venice.brooklynrail.org">Venice Biennale</a> and the <a href="https://www.colby.edu/museum/exhibition/occupy-colby-artists-need-to-create-on-the-same-scale-that-society-has-the-capacity-to-destroy-year-2/">Colby Museum</a>, two special issues of the River Rail, <a href="https://shop.brooklynrail.org">three new releases from our literary press Rail Editions</a>, and the continued publication of our <a href="https://brooklynrail.org/subscribe">ten annual issues</a>, now read each month by 200,000 individuals around the world.</p>
