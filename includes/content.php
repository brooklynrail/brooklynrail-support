  <p>For 19 years, The Brooklyn Rail has never wavered in its commitment to providing an accessible, independent forum for the arts. 2019 has been a particularly monumental year for the Rail, with curatorial projects at both the <a href="https://venice.brooklynrail.org">Venice Biennale</a> and the Colby Museum, two special issues of the River Rail, <a href="https://shop.brooklynrail.org">three new releases from our literary press Rail Editions</a>, and the continued publication of our <a href="https://brooklynrail.org/subscribe">ten annual issues</a>, now read each month by 200,000 individuals around the world.</p>

  <p>To continue to expand our reach throughout 2020, we hope to raise $50,000 by December 31st, 2019 from members of our community. As a non-profit, individual donors are integral to all we do. The support of artists, writers, friends, and patrons sustains our public programming, and allows us to put critical and imaginative writing in the hands of the public each month.</p>

  <p><strong>Please consider donating to help keep the Rail independent and free for all.</strong></p>
