          <p>In our eighteen years we have never wavered in our commitment to free distribution; the creative labor of artists and writers; and reflecting the diversity, complexity, and inventiveness of our cultural landscape.</p>

          <p>We reach over fifty thousand readers monthly, who pick up the <em>Rail</em> in print or read the <em>Rail</em> online. In order to bring rigorous, imaginative writing into the hands of the public each month, we depend on individual donations from our readers.</p>

          <p>At this critical juncture, we are asking for your support to keep the <em>Rail</em> free for artists and lovers of art everywhere.</p>

          <p><strong>The Brooklyn Rail is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, and your donation is fully deductible.</strong></p>
