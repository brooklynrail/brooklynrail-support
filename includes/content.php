  <p>This month marks the nineteenth anniversary of The Brookly Railâ€™s creation. This past year has been a monumental one, with curatorial projects at both the Venice Biennale and the Colby Museum, two special issues of the River Rail, three new releases from our literary press Rail Editions, and the continued publication of our ten annual issues, now read each month by 200,000 individuals around the world.</p>

  <p>This year has also come with challenges to free speech, artistic freedom, and our democratic system. Now more than ever, the principles of journalistic independence and egalitarianism that grounded the founding of the Rail are under threat. It is with this in mind that I respectfully ask for your support.</p>

  <p>We aim to raise $50,000 by December 31st from members of our community. As a nonprofit, the support of artists, writers, friends, and patrons allows us to expand our reach while compensating the hundreds of contributors whose words appear in every issue.</p>
